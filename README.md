# CLI Mancala

Ever have the burning desire to play mancala but no one is around to play with you and you have no motivation to go get out the mancala board? Then you need CLI Mancala!

## Bookmark Mancala

I also translated my Haskell Mancala program into JavaScript so that it can be ran in a bookmark. Just minify the code, then prepend `javascript:` to the front of the minified output and copy it into the URL of a Chrome bookmark and click on the bookmark whenever you want to play some Mancala.
